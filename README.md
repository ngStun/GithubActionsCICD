# CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This repository demonstrates how to implement Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions). It provides a step-by-step example of automating testing, building, and deployment processes to ensure high-quality code and efficient delivery pipelines.

## Features

- **Continuous Integration**: Automates the process of building and testing the code on every push or pull request.
- **Continuous Delivery**: Automatically deploys the application to a staging/production environment once the tests pass.
- **GitHub Actions Workflows**: Leverages GitHub Actions to define and manage the entire pipeline in YAML configuration files.
